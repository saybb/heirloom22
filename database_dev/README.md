- [Database design (Lucid chart)](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/5273bef4-c7d5-441d-9155-24498632c760)

## Firebase API
Currently using Heirloom22
project-id: heirloom22-2b4a8

```javascript
var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyC1HQX45nzJr6SDRMsPkA_zAgAYM9iGjTg",
    authDomain: "heirloom22-2b4a8.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://heirloom22-2b4a8.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "heirloom22-2b4a8",
    storageBucket: "heirloom22-2b4a8.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "323147351760",
    appId: "1:323147351760:web:bf785136b38cb3a4d380d5"
};
```

## Reset or Upload test data to firebase
1. Open index.html in browser
2. Delete the database (optional) 
3. Upload the database (will overwrite exisiting data)

## Test data

- Test data is stored as javascript objects
- path to test data `./Test_data/data.js`

## Sprint 2 clarification (Database)

Deadline

- Week 8

Aim

1. Store all required information
2. Support all required queries
3. Model data to support desired relations
4. Interactive query testing web page

Not supporting 

1. No Multimedia 
    - Will be done in the next sprint
2. Can't determine which documents user can access
    - Oliver is responsible for user access and authentication. 
3. Geospatial data 
    - Currently there isn't a UI solution for input or output geospatial data

## Database conventions

Document ID 

- Also known as file name
- Lowercase
- Syntax `<descriptive_name>_id` 
- Where `<descriptive_name>` is manually selected by me to make it easy to debug
- User generated data will have autogenerated id like 42OqXx2K1bX7V4CfHkGt

Fields

- Lowercase
- Words separated by underscore like `artifacts_link`

Database and subcollections

- Also known as a folder
- Capitalize
- Plurals
- List of collections
  - `Artifacts`
  - `People`
  - `Addendums`
  - `Events`
  - `Users` 

Important fields

- All documents except `User_authentication_files` must have
  - `date_created` : the date and time the document was created
  - `created_by` : the name user who created the data


## Week 6-7 plan

1. Create sample data and automate upload (For resetting)
2. Get a list of necessary queries from requirements 
    1. Create queries
3. Interactive webpage to display queries
